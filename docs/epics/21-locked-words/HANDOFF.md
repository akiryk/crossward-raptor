# Locked words — Handoff

## Read first

1. This handoff; AGENTS only if not already supplied.
2. The [EPIC](EPIC.md), then the active story.

## Current state (2026-11-06)

The EPIC's decisions came from an interview with the human 2026-11-06.
**The human approved the EPIC 2026-11-06.**

- [S1 The word highlight](stories/21-S1-word-highlight.md): **done**,
  delivered on `main` (frozen at 69407b0). Its `buildWord`
  (`src/lib/build-word.ts`) is the run S2 and S3 reuse.
- [S2 Lock and unlock a word](stories/21-S2-lock-a-word.md): **done**.
  Frozen at b45a4c6; [PR #33](https://github.com/akiryk/crossward-raptor/pull/33)
  independently reviewed (no blockers) and merged to `main` 2026-11-06 as
  693c02b. Its `src/lib/locked-words.ts` helpers and the stored
  `lockedWords` list are what S3–S6 build on.
- [S3 Locked cells hold](stories/21-S3-locked-cells-hold.md): drafted;
  acceptance tests not yet written; not approved. Next.
- [S4 The lock button's tooltip](stories/21-S4-lock-tooltip.md): drafted.
- [S5 Lock Word in the toggle row](stories/21-S5-toggle-row-lock.md):
  drafted.
- [S6 Reset Grid with locked words](stories/21-S6-reset-with-locks.md):
  drafted.

**Delegation (the human, 2026-11-06):** one orchestrating agent carries
S3–S6 to done without human checkpoints. For each story it may draft and
approve the specification and acceptance, then freeze them (STORY §2).
Decisions stay within the approved EPIC's Decisions and Non-goals. A
product detail the EPIC leaves open is decided by the agent and recorded in
the story under "Delegated decisions", for the human's visual check. A frozen
test found wrong may be corrected without the human, but only after an
independent agent reviews the correction and it lands in its own
spec-only commit on `main` (STORY §3). Implementation, review and audit go to
separate subagents. The author never reviews or audits its own work. A
risk-path PR is merged by its independent reviewer. At the end, an
independent report-only audit runs (AUDIT). The epic is **not** closed:
the human does visual testing first. Still stop for anything outside this
epic, data deletion beyond the guarded test reset, or a true blocker.

Epic 20 is closed (ba55af6). Epic 18's 18-S5-5 intermittent can fail a
full browser run; it's a recorded open item, unrelated to this epic.

## Verification (2026-11-06, PR #33 head b05141e, by the reviewer)

- `npm run verify`: exit 0 (677 unit tests).
- Full `npm run test:e2e`: 1064 passed, exit 0.
- Frozen acceptance unchanged since b45a4c6.
- CI: Vercel deployment only (no unit/E2E gates), passed.

## Review notes (PR #33, non-blocking)

- The lock button follows the editor's focus, as the cursor highlight
  does, so Tab past it to Reset Grid leaves it showing
  (`PuzzleGridEditor.tsx`, `lockTarget`).
- An outline's React key is its start and direction, so a locked word and
  a longer run from the same start could share one (a dev warning). Only
  reachable by typing into an end cell, which S3 blocks.

## Next action

Orchestrate S3 through S6 under the delegation above, in order: draft,
self-approve and freeze each story, then implement it, independently
review it (and merge it if it's on a risk path) and verify it. Then run
the independent closeout audit and stop for the human's visual testing.
Keep this handoff current after each story.

## Resume prompt

Read docs/epics/21-locked-words/HANDOFF.md. As orchestrator, carry Epic 21's
S3–S6 to done under the handoff's delegation, then run the closeout audit and
stop for the human's visual testing; don't close the epic.
